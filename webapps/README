This folder contains subfolders, each of which should be a fully
self-contained and deployable web app (such as a dashboards).

To run the dashboards web app in debug mode on port 5000:

    analytics/webapps/dashboards/main.py -d


TIPS:
- You may want to create a separate virtualenv into which you'll
  install Python packages for the analytics repo:

  sudo pip install virtualenv
  virtualenv ~/.virtualenv/analytics
  source ~/.virtualenv/analytics/bin/activate

- Make sure you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the
  root of the analytics repo.
  - If this doesn't work, you can try installing items one-at-time
    until it works. First try to comment out numpy or scipy.
  - If you get an error about a Fortran installer for numpy or scipy,
    try the instructions at one of these places:
