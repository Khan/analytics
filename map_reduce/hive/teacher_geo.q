-- Script to geolocate teachers using their ip addresses
-- Uses last 180 days of ProblemLog to get most popular ip for given user

-- Depends on:
--   1. map_reduce/hive/student_teacher_current.q
--   2. third_party/pygeoip/pygeoip
--   3. GeoLiteCity.dat (only in S3 under path specified below)

-- There are several steps to this query
--  1st: Map users from ProblemLog to their most popular ip address
--   from last 180 days
--  2nd: Join teachers and users to find most popular ip for each
--   coach who has become a teacher before end_dt
--      2.1st: Peform geolocation
--      2.2nd: Add size of the class to each teacher entry
--  3rd: Join geolocated teachers with their user information
--   for friendlier display

-- Arguments:
--   end_dt: exclusive end date in YYYY-MM-DD format

-- Files below will be moved to pygeoip/ subdirecotry
--  for use as a python module
