    # specific.  E.g. paths, names, constants, and servers that are shared
    # across multiple analytics uses should live here. 

    # this section contains all connection information necessary to connect 
    # to a logically named server.  The entries are organized first by a 
    # named type (e.g., 'mongo'), then by a server name (e.g., 'datastore').  
    # The format of the entry values will depend on the server type, but 
    # will typically include at least host and port info.
